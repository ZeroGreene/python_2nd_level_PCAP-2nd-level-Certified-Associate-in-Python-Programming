==========
  chapters of the pcap exam

---------------------------
  If you mean PCAP – Certified Associate in Python Programming (from the Python Institute), here are the main “chapters” (sections / domains) of the exam — i.e. what it tests on
==========================
  
  PCAP Exam: Main Sections (for current PCAP-31-03)
The exam is divided into five major domains: pythoninstitute.org+1
SectionTopic / Focus
  0.Modules & Packages — ~ 12%Importing and using modules/packages, organizing code into packages, using standard modules like math, random, platform. pythoninstitute.org+1
  1.Exceptions — ~ 14%Handling errors and exceptions: try/except, raising exceptions, using / defining exception types. cramkey.com+1
  2.Strings — ~ 18%Working with string data: encodings (ASCII/Unicode/UTF-8), indexing, slicing, immutability, string methods and operations. pythoninstitute.org+1
  3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — ~ 34%Classes and objects: defining classes, inheritance (single/multiple), encapsulation, special methods (__init__, __str__), class vs. instance variables, introspection, polymorphism, name-mangling. pythoninstitute.org+2cramkey.com+2
  4. Miscellaneous (Comprehensions, Lambdas, Closures, I/O / File Operations) — ~ 22%This includes list comprehensions, lambda expressions, closures, file input/output (text & binary), and related operations (open, read, write, streams). pythoninstitute.org+2pythoninstitute.org+2
============================================
  
⚠️ Note: Past (Retired) Version — PCAP-31-02
If you referenced older materials, there was a previous version of PCAP (PCAP-31-02 Exam), which had slightly different structure. It included four sections with roughly equal weight (25% each): “Control & Evaluations”, “Data Aggregates”, “Functions & Modules”, and “Classes, Objects & Exceptions”. pythoninstitute.org+2pythoninstitute.org+2

=============================================
✅ What this means for you


If you plan to take PCAP now, you should follow the PCAP-31-03 syllabus — the five-part breakdown above.

Focus especially on OOP, string handling, and miscellaneous topics (comprehensions, lambdas, I/O) because they make up more than half the exam weight.

Also be comfortable with modules/packages, and exceptions — those round out the foundational Python skills the exam tests.

If you like — I can pull up the full latest PCAP-31-03 syllabus PDF with all subtopics (lists, dictionaries, methods, standard libraries, etc.) so you have a single checklist to prep from. Do you want me to grab that for you now?
